# 23Na-3He-d-Analysis
Data and scripts for the 23Na(3He,d) project

orig_spec_data.tar contains the original spectra from the experiment within deuteron gates. Elastic scattering and transfer data are provided at each angle. The elastic scattered 3He readings from silicon detector are also attached as ES-Si. Please check the paper for the angle ranges. Those files were under my directory: /SpecData/Spec_txt.
processed_yield_and_misc.tar contains mostly peak characteristics extracted from the raw spectra, and other information that served as intermediate steps of the calculations. Those files were under my directory: /SpecData.
FrescoInputData.tar and FrescoInputFiles.tar are as their names saying.
